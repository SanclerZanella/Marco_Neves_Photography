## UX
---
### The purpose of the website is to present the follow values:
  * Introduce who is Marco Neves Photography and his job, so that the client can become familiar.

  * Show his portfolio, making his job seem credible by creating a simple and professional desing, so that the client can become confident.
  * Make sure that there is a easy and quickly way to reach the **contact page**, to potentially increase the client base.
  * Create a resposive design, wich works in different screen sizes and devices, due the fact that people use more mobile devices nowadays.

### User Stories:
  1. I am a bride who wants to record each moment of my wedding. I need to be convinced that the photographer is professional and I also want to navigate through the website easily, because I have plenty of things to deal during the organization of my wedding and I can't waste time.

  2. We are a couple who wants a photographer to record our pre-wedding. we are looking for a photographer with authentic ideas and the website design would be like a business card, showing the style of the photographer work.

  3. I am a pregnant who wants to have some photos of the final stage of my pregnancy and I am looking for a good professional by my phone, I expect to have a good experience on this device.

### Design Process:
  * I began the design process by outlining the key features that I wanted my website to have and thought about what might be the most intuitive way to navigate through each page. This led me to decide on the four pages I would have on my website: 'Home', 'Portfolio', 'Bio' and 'Contact Us'.

  * In the same way, I decided to fix the navigation bar in the top of the page while the user scroll and navigate through the page, to keep a easy way to reach the another page, mainly the contact page.

  * I decided to build the 'Portfolio' as a dropdown menu, bringing different options like 'Weddings', 'pre-weddings' and 'family photos', each of these options redirect to another page with the same names as the options. Inside each of these pages there are different image links that redirect to an album.

  * I decided to apply breadcrumbs in the album pages to provide an easily navigation, the breadcrumb link go exactly to the point where the user was in the page before click in the link. 

  * After receive the visual identity from the client I decided the body color would be a "shade of white", with details in orange and letter color in black, and using the Montserrat font for general content, Montserrat font in bolder weight for headings and the Arizonia font for signatures and some headings, Following The instructions from the visual identity. The style guide can be seen here: [Style Guide](assets/files/style_guide.pdf) 

  * The layout changes in different screen sizes, I chose for take out some content in smaller screens to the content fits well in theses smaller screens, but the main content still in the website, and I changed The rows and columns arrangement to fit the content well.


### Wireframing my project on Balsamiq

### Testing in different browsers

I manually tested the website on the following web browsers, checking that buttons, responsiveness and design worked as planned:

  * Google Chrome

### Testing responsiveness

I manually tested the live project by doing the following:
  
  * Using Google Developer Tools to view the project on devices with different screen sizes.
  * Asking for feedback from friends and family who opened and interacted with the project on their devices.

### Issues found

  1. I planned to open each photo on portfolios pages in a modal, I implemented the modal with a carousel, but when I click on any photo the modal opens always in the first photo in a carousel. I don't have yet the knowledge to fix it with JavaScript. All photos keep being shown in the modal carousel control. I will implement a function to to prevent this from happening in a similar situation.

  2. I noted that the Mozilla Firefox render the photos better than the Google Chrome. I don't have yet the knowledge to fix it.
