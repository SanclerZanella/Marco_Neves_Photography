### The purpose of the website is to present the follow values:
* Introduce who is Marco Neves Photography and his job, so that the client can become familiar.

* Show his portfolio, making his job seem credible by creating a simple and professional desing, so that the client can become confident.
* Make sure that there is a easy and quickly way to reach the **contact page**, to potentially increase the client base.
* Create a resposive design, wich works in different screen sizes and devices.

### User Stories:
* I am a bride who wants to record each moment of my wedding. I need to be convinced that the photographer is professional and I also want to navigate through the website easily, because I have plenty of things to deal during the organization of my wedding and I can't waste time.

* We are a couple who wants a photographer to record our pre-wedding. we are looking for a photographer with authentic ideas and the website design would be like a business card, showing the style of the photographer work.
* I am a pregnant who wants to have some photos of the final stage of my pregnancy and I am looking for a good professional by my phone, I expect to have a good experience on this device.

### Design Process:
* I began the design process by outlining the key features that I wanted my website to have and thought about what might be the most intuitive way to navigate through each page. This led me to decide on the four pages I would have on my website: 'Home', 'Portfolio', 'Bio' and 'Contact Us'.

* I decided to build the 'Portfolio' as a dropdown menu, bringing different options like 'Weddings', 'pre-weddings' and 'family photos', each of these options redirect to another page with the same names as the options. Inside each of these pages there are different image links that redirect to an album.

* I decided to apply breadcrumbs to provide an easily navigation, mainly in the pages that are not in the navigation bar options.
